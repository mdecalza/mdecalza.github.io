                Over the course of my life, I have learned to apply my abilities to a wide variety of situations. I began my journey as an artist in grade school, making pixel art in Microsoft Paint and lending designs to Game Maker projects. I also found a passion for pencil drawing. In high school, I was graciously gifted my first Intuos tablet, and I began to draw and paint digitally in Photoshop while taking art classes at school.<br/>
                <br/>
                I&apos;ve since used my design skills to provide illustrations and graphics for game design projects, websites (including this one!), YouTube videos, and more. I continue to share my artistic progress on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_decalzone/">Instagram</a> and on <Link to={{ pathname: "/art", }}>my Art page</Link>.

                Since 2018, I&apos;ve been quietly broadcasting my musical experiments from my home studio in Northern Colorado under the pseudonym <Link to={{ pathname: "/music", }}>Sontomorio</Link>.<br/>
                <br/>
                Though quite amateur, my first songs <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/66LjOq1s89FIYDqgZxqRNS"><i>Strangest Ways</i></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/YUDLJnq4plE"><i>Space and Time (Unkillable Nature)</i></a> showcased my obsession with lofi, bedroom pop, rap, and musical experimentation. This eclectic combination of sounds coalesced into my maligned mixtape debut, <i>Deibyu</i>. However mixed the tape, <i>Deibyu</i> was a huge accomplishment for me as an musician, and marked my first of many collaborations with Aspen &quot;Shreds&quot; Abrahamson and Josh Jacquot.<br/>
                <br/>
                Itching to improve my sound, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3xzAg3WGHvCTD05r7pqsJG"><i>Burning My Time Building My Mind</i></a> was released mere months later in April 2019. In contrast to my debut record, <i>Burning My Time...</i> features soft, sleek production with mostly instrumental songs.<br/>
                <br/>
                As 2019 was coming to an end, I began experimenting with heavier samples and more ambitious production. The <a href="https://youtu.be/cs69xVqK1lo"><i>Midnight Movies</i></a> mixtape was released in December 2019, showcasing more overtly my taste for humorous samples and light, funky hip-hop. The latter half of the record featured more original compositions, however, leading to the release of the singles <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3fUzaulddG1m6Hs6ai625V"><i>Golden Eyes</i></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/bOTfRunns14"><i>When We Make It</i></a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/PLhzyLvYiwM"><i>The Forest Spirits</i></a>.<br/>
                <br/>
                I still experiment with new sounds into the 2020s, releasing new music on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPeP7F5d_NSwuAxlEMr3ukQ">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sontomorio">SoundCloud</a>. The mix EP <a href="https://youtu.be/Z7dY-NgBeVo"><i>Sonto IV</i></a> (2020) showcases some of my most abrasive hip-hop production yet, while the beattapes <a href="https://youtu.be/2FK6yWV96O8"><i>The Freeway</i></a> (2021) and <a href="https://youtu.be/fJ5Bcy_MBqE"><i>Sonto&apos;olegio</i></a> (2022) each feature more lo-fi production over a variety of genres.
